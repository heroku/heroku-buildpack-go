Error: Your app is configured to use the Go buildpack,
but we couldn't find a go.mod file.

A Go app on Heroku must have a 'go.mod' file in the root
directory of its source code.

Currently the root directory of your app contains:

$(ls -1A --indicator-style=slash "${build}" || true)

If your app already has a go.mod file, check that it:

1. Is in the top level directory (not a subdirectory).
2. Has the correct spelling (the filenames are case-sensitive).
3. Isn't listed in '.gitignore' or '.slugignore'.
4. Has been added to Git using 'git add go.mod' and committed.

To create a go.mod file, run 'go mod init <module-name>' in your
project directory.

For help with using Go on Heroku, see:
