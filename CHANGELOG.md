# Go Buildpack Changelog

## Unreleased

## v87 (2018-05-03)

* Add go1.10.2 and go1.9.6
* Default to go1.10.2
* go1.10 expands to go1.10.2 and go1.9 expands to go1.9.6

## v86 (2018-04-17)

* Add go1.10.1 and go1.9.5
* Default to go1.10.1
* go1.10 expands to go1.10.1 and go1.9 expands to go1.9.5
* Deprecate go1.8*

## v85 (2018-02-23)

* Check to see if the buildpack knows about a file before trying to download it. Fixes #227.
* Fixed GO_LINKER_SYMBOL handling for go1.10+ (Thanks @djui)

## v84 (2018-02-16)

* Better naked version expansion that allows not only for 1.9 -> go1.9.4, but also 1.9.4 -> go1.9.4, which was missing previously.
* Add support for go1.10 (which will expand to the current go1.10.X version) and go1.10.0 (which pins to go1.10).
* Add `make sync` target and update README around syncing.

## v83 (2018-02-08)

* Add go1.10rc2 and default go1.10 to it.
* Add `1.X` versions expansions. Previously the full version string needed to start with `go`. Example: `go1.9` was required instead of `1.9`. Now both expand to the current go 1.9 version (currently `go1.9.4`).

## v82 (2018-02-07)

* Add go1.9.4 & 1.8.7 and default go1.9/go1.8 to them.

## v81 (2018-01-26)

* Bump dep to v0.4.0
* Bump dep to v0.4.1
* Add go1.10rc1 and default it as the version for go1.10

## v80 (2018-01-24)

* Add go1.9.3 and make it the default

## v79 (2018-01-17)

* Add go1.10beta1 and go1.10beta2

## v78 (2017-10-26)

* Add go1.9.2 and go1.8.5 and default go1.9/go1.8 to them.

## v77 (2017-10-17)

* Add support for Git credentials specified via config vars. See [here](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-go#private-git-repos) for more info. So far this has only been tested with Github and personal access tokens over https, but should work for other methods as well.
* Tests now use a local file:// URL for most dependencies. This enables offline mode for most tests and makes it easier to test local changes before syncing the production bucket.
* Tests now better us shunit2 setup/teardown, instead of not cleaning up after themselves.
* Run tests against both the older heroku/cedar:14 image and the new heroku/heroku:16-build image.
* Because of the three changes above, tests are now faster.
* Allow `go1.X.0` versions that expand to `go1.X`, effectively pinning the minor version to the first version in the X series.

## v40 (2016-05-18)

    1. warn goes to stdout, not stderr
    1. a new function 'err' writes to stderr (in red)
    1. 'warn'ing that used to exit 1 after now 'err' instead
    1. UNSET VendorExperiment if a Godeps/_workspace/src directory exists
